# **Encrypt/Decrypt Files Project**

## **Team Members**
- **Mateo Silva**
- **Ana Sofia Londo√±o**
- **Sara Cardona**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a secure file encryption and decryption application as part of a cybersecurity initiative. The main functionality revolves around securely encrypting files using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key derived from a password via PBKDF2, and validating file integrity with a SHA-256 hash. The decryption process verifies the integrity of the file by comparing the computed and stored hashes.

The project serves as an educational application of cryptographic principles, focusing on:
1. Strong encryption techniques.
2. Secure key derivation methods.
3. Data integrity validation through hashing.

This project adheres to cybersecurity best practices and demonstrates robust handling of sensitive data.

## **Features**

### **1. Encrypt File**
- **Input**: A file and a password provided by the user.
- **Process**:
  - Derive a secure 256-bit key from the password using PBKDF2 with a random salt.
  - Encrypt the file contents using AES-256 in CBC mode with a randomly generated IV (Initialization Vector).
  - Compute the SHA-256 hash of the original file and append it to the encrypted file for later integrity verification.
- **Output**: The encrypted file is saved with the `.encrypted` extension in the same directory as the input file.

### **2. Decrypt File**
- **Input**: An encrypted file and the correct password.
- **Process**:
  - Extract the salt, IV, and SHA-256 hash from the encrypted file.
  - Derive the 256-bit key from the provided password using PBKDF2 and the extracted salt.
  - Decrypt the file using AES-256 in CBC mode and the derived key.
  - Compute the SHA-256 hash of the decrypted file and compare it with the extracted hash.
- **Output**: The decrypted file is saved with the `.decrypted` extension. If the hashes match, the decryption is deemed successful.

### **3. Input Validation**
- Ensures that:
  - The file path is not empty and points to an existing file.
  - The password is not empty.

### **4. Error Handling**
- Clear error messages for invalid file paths, incorrect passwords, or file corruption.
- Ensures the integrity of the cryptographic processes.

## **Technical Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: JavaFX (for the graphical user interface)
- **Cryptographic Library**: Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)

3. **File Handling**:
   - Reads and writes files securely, ensuring proper cleanup of resources.
   - Includes robust error handling for file I/O operations.

4. **Cryptographic Functions**:
   - Key derivation using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256.
   - Encryption and decryption using AES-256 in CBC mode.
   - File hashing using SHA-256 for integrity validation.
